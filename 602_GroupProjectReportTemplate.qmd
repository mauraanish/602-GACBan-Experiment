# Introduction
<!--
What is your experiment about (4-5 sentences).
-->

# Methodology
<!--
Describe your experiment design, including: (1) experiment design, (2) treatments, (3) outcome variable(s), (4) sample size, and (5) data cleaning procedures (if applicable) [8-10 sentences]
-->

# Analysis

<!--
Which statistical test is used, and why? [3-4 sentences]
-->

<!--
Run the chosen test! To do so: (1) import the libraries you need, (2) import your data, (3) double-check the names of your IV(s) and DV, and (4) run the test. For information on the libraries and R syntax, refer to see Lecture 10.
-->

```{r}
# import libraries
# import data
# test!

```




# Results
<!--
Report and interpret the test results. For information on what should be included, refer to lecture 10. Also add at least one plot.
-->




# Findings
<!--
Findings: Report the statistic you obtained along with the information to decide whether the null hypothesis can be rejected or not. Use a plot and/or table with a proper label.
-->



# Discussion
<!--
What are the implications of the study? What are possible explanations if the results do not align with your hypothesis? Any suggestions for future studies?
-->



### For your information
<!--
Some example code for different plots. Below is only for your information. Submit your report after removing this section.

```{r}
# the built-in R data set named ToothGrowth:
# data from a study evaluating the effect of Vitamin C on tooth growth in Guinea pigs.
# The experiment has been performed on 60 pigs, where each animal received one of three dose levels of vitamin C (0.5, 1, and 2 mg/day) by one of two delivery methods, orange juice or ascorbic acid (a form of vitamin C and coded as VC). Tooth length was measured and a sample of the data is shown below
my_data = ToothGrowth
str(my_data)

# Convert dose as a factor and recode the levels
# as D0.5, D1, D2
my_data$dose <- factor(my_data$dose,
                       levels = c(0.5, 1, 2),
                       labels = c("D0.5", "D1", "D2"))
head(my_data)

# frequency table:
table(my_data$supp, my_data$dose)
```


```{r}
# Line plots with multiple groups
# plot tooth length ("len") by groups ("dose")
# color box plot by a second group: "supp"
# add error bars: mean_se
library(ggpubr)
ggline(my_data, x = "dose", y = "len", color = "supp",
       add = c("mean_se", "dotplot"),
       palette = c("#00AFBB", "#E7B800"))

# OR
# using R base graphs:
boxplot(len ~ supp * dose, data = my_data, frame = FALSE,
        col = c("#00AFBB", "#E7B800"), ylab = "Tooth Length")

# Another example: Two-way interaction plot
interaction.plot(x.factor = my_data$dose, trace.factor = my_data$supp, 
                 # x.factor: the factor to be plotted on x axis
                 # trace.factor: the factor to be plotted as lines
                 # response: a numeric variable giving the response
                 response = my_data$len, fun = mean,
                 # type: the type of plot (p: point, l: line, b: both point and line)
                 type = "b", legend = TRUE,
                 xlab = "Dose", ylab = "Tooth Length",
                 pch = c(1, 19), col = c("#00AFBB", "#E7B800"))
