# 602-GACBan-Experiment
In collaboration with three other students in DACSS 602: Research Design, taught by Dr. Eunkyung Song at UMass Amherst, I designed a survey-experiment to investigate whether American adults' attitudes towards gender-affirming care for transgender minors would be impacted by factual, credible information about such care. After evaluating respondents' prior beliefs about puberty blockers (one form of gender-affirming care) our experiment randomly assigned respondents to view one of four infographics with information about what puberty blockers do. Two of the four infographics attributed the information to the Mayo Clinic (a reputable source), and two of the four infographics included a statistic about the impact of puberty blockers, resulting in one infographic with a source and a statistic, a second infographic with a source but no statistic, a third infographic with no source but a statistic, and a fourth infographic with no source and no statistic. Respondents' support for a ban of gender-affirming care for transgender minors and their support for access to puberty blockers for transgender minors when medically necessary were evaluated after the exposure to the treatments.
